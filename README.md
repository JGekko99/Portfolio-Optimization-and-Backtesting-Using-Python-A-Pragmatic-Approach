# Portfolio Optimization and Backtesting Using-Python A Pragmatic Approach

## Abstract

This research explores the application of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and
Monte Carlo simulations to optimize and backtest a portfolio of various financial
assets. By employing Python for data analysis and visualization, we aim to construct
a portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe Ratio and adapt it to changing market
conditions through rolling window optimization. The analysis integrates data cleaning,
correlation analysis, risk-free rate calculation, and practical implications of the
results. This study provides a comprehensive examination of the methods used, the
execution of the analysis, and the results obtained.

## What's Inside:


- The folder from our repository on Github containing:


  - The Portfolio_Optimizarion_BK.ipynb. file from the Jupyter Notebook with the code in Python;


  - The “requirements.txt” file containing the list of libraries required to run the code;


  - The folders containing the CSVs with the data used for our analysis.


Each reference to these files was implemented in the code as a path  relative, so that we do not have to adapt the path for each 
machine on which the code runs. To preserve the tree  directory, simply unzip the zipped folder and open it 
as a Workspace within Visual Studio Code.

- The PDF also written with LaTeX that outlines each member's contribution in the group project, as well as the coordinator.
